This example is excluded from CI testing because it requires:
1. A valid TLS/SSL certificate (PFX or PEM format) with a private key
2. An Azure Key Vault with appropriate access policies
3. Either pre-provisioned certificate data or Key Vault secret references

These dependencies cannot be automatically provisioned in the CI environment and require manual setup, domain ownership verification, and certificate authority interaction.

This example should be manually validated when certificate-related changes are made to the module.
