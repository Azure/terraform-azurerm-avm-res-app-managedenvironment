This example is excluded from CI testing because it requires:
1. A registered domain name with DNS management access
2. Ability to create DNS records (CNAME, TXT, or host HTTP validation files)
3. Time for DNS propagation and certificate authority validation (can take several minutes to hours)
4. Azure-managed certificate provisioning and renewal

These dependencies cannot be automatically provisioned in the CI environment and require:
- Domain ownership verification
- DNS configuration access
- Certificate authority interaction and validation time

This example should be manually validated when managed certificate-related changes are made to the module.
